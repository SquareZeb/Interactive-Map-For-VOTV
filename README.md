## Satellite Dishes:
For the satellite dishes, you can toggle or flip flop between classic named dishes or normal named dishes you can choose only one of the two. If you want the satellite dish marker set of either to disappear completely just click it again. To re-enable it again click either of the two.

## Map Alignment:
On the top you'll see another bar which is used for map alignment, you can toggle between left, center, and right alignment which will align the map and its contents to the specified side. This is useful for when you want to view specific markers that are on the edge or can make it easier to look at.

## Coordinate System:
There is a coordinate system at the bottom, while it may not be 100% accurate due to the map distances and map flatness, however it can still be used to get a good general area of wherever you are looking at.
